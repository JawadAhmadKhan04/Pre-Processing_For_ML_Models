# Python Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This project utilizes popular Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `jupyter notebook`.

## Installation

Its better to use a virtual environment for project dependencies, maintaining isolated and clean workspaces, and ensuring reproducibility and flexibility in Python development. 

### Installing a virtual environment

To install the package for  virtual environment run the following command:

```sh
pip install virtual venv
```

Now browse to the folder which is to be used and set up the virtual environment by running the command:

```sh
python -m venv name_of_virtual_env
```

To activate the virtual environment run the following command:
```sh
name_of_virtual_env\Scipts\activate.bat
```
activate.bat is for windows


### Installing Libraries

To get started, you'll need to install the required libraries.

You can do this using `pip` by running the following command:
Pandas, Numpy and Scikit learn are used for Data Anlysis, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for Data Visualization

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

We would be using Jupyter Notebook envirnonment.
To install, run the following command:

```sh
pip install jupyter
```
